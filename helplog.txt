How to Triangluar the mesh.
Solved:
 first I tried the method teached in the class, but this way would change the variables in mesh, and according the piazza, we should not do this. Then I triangulate the mesh when create() by triangulate the index buffer.

The mainwindows cannot create the Mesh variables
Solved:
When I did 4.5, I first planed to load the OBJ file in mainwindows and create a Mesh variable in mainwindows, then set the value by OBJ file and pass the mesh variable by signal-slot to MyGL. However, the mainwindows cannot create a Mesh variable because of the initialization is different.
Thus I just passed a signal to call the Loading function in MyGL and it worked.

I didn’t know the requirement of 4.6 that “you could use GLSL's sine function in conjunction with u_Time and the built-in GLSL variable gl_FragCoord (the screen-space position of a fragment) to modify the red, green, and blue channels of a fragment.”
Unsolved:
I just wrote a simple calculation of gl_FragCoord with u_Time and diifuseColor to change the color of fragment, but the effect is a little strange.
